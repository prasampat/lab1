I used some resources to solve the code and just wanted to see and make an approach by a specfic code from:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-to-check-whether-a-number-is-prime-or-not/

Complile through:

gcc -o file1 file1.c

./file1

In this code I am taking an imput from user and storing it to given_number variable.
Then running a for loop with the formula and putting if and else if condition
